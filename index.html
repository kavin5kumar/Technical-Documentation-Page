        Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.

      Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain.

      It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.

      It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</p><p>

      It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.

      It supports automatic garbage collection.

      It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.

      Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain .Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.

     <p>Python is available on a wide variety of platforms. Let's understand how to set up our Python environment.</p>
    <p>Python works in</p>
   
    <ul>
      <li>Unix (Solaris, Linux, FreeBSD, AIX, HP/UX, SunOS, IRIX, etc.)</li>
      <li>Win 9x/NT/2000</li>
      <li>Macintosh (Intel, PPC, 68K)</li>
      <li>OS/2</li>
      <li>DOS (multiple versions)</li>
      <li>PalmOS</li>
      <li>Acorn/RISC OS</li>
      <li>BeOS</li>
      <li>Amiga</li>
      <li>VMS/OpenVMS</li>
      <li>QNX</li>
      <li>VxWorks</li>
      <li>Psion</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It also can be ported to the Java and .NET virtual machines.The most up-to-date and current source code, binaries, documentation, news, etc., is available on the <a  href="https://www.python.org/"> official website of Python</a>.The Python language has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java.</p>
       <p>>There are different modes of programming in Python which are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><u><b>Interactive Mode Programming:</b></u></li>
      <p>It involves in invoking the interpreter without passing a script file as a parameter.We cam type the following text at the Python prompt and press the Enter key to Initialize them.
        <code>
         $ python
            Python 2.4.3 (#1, Nov 11 2010, 13:34:43)
            [GCC 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-48)] on linux2
            Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
            &gt&gt&gt print "Hello, Python!"
        </code>
<p>We get the Output as:</p>
          <code>Hello, Python!</code>
        <li><u><b>Script Mode Programming:</b></u></li>
        <p >It invokes the interpreter with a script parameter begins execution of the script and continues until the script is finished. When the script is finished, the interpreter is no longer active.Let us write a simple Python program in a script. Python files have extension .py. Type the following source code in a test.py file and 

          <code>print "Hello, Python!"</code>
      <p>We get the Output as:</p>
          <code>Hello, Python!</code>
    </ul>
    </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Types">
    <header>Variable Types</header>
    <article>
        <p>Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.

        Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.
        Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.

        The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable.</p>

      <p>Here, 100, 1000.0 and "John" are the values assigned to counter, miles, and name variables, respectively. This produces the following result −</p>

        <code>#!/usr/bin/python
        counter = 100 # An integer assignment
        miles = 1000.0 # A floating point
        name = "John" # A string
        print counter
        print miles
        print name</code>
      <p>We get the Output as:</p>
      <code>
        100
        1000.0
        John</code>

      <p id="para7">The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, a person's age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is stored as alphanumeric characters. Python has various standard data types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the storage method for each of them.Python has five standard data types −
        Numbers,
        String,
        List,
        Tuple and
        Dictionary.</p>
      <br>
      <ul id="list2">
        <li><u><b>Numbers:</b></u></li>
        <p id="listpara3">Number data types store numeric values. Number objects are created when you assign a value to them.You can also delete the reference to a number object by using the del statement.Python supports four different numerical types −
          
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1.int (signed integers)
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2.long (long integers, they can also be represented in octal and hexadecimal)
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3.float (floating point real values)
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp4.complex (complex numbers)
          Here are some examples of numbers : -786,-0x19323L,-21.9,3e+26J.
        </p>
        <li><u><b>Strings</b></u></li>
        <p>Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks. Python allows for either pairs of single or double quotes. Subsets of strings can be taken using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the string and working their way from -1 at the end.

          The plus (+) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator.
          
          <code>#!/usr/bin/python
            
            str = 'Hello World!'
            print str # Prints complete string
            print str[0] # Prints first character of the string
            print str[2:5] # Prints characters starting from 3rd to 5th
            print str[2:] # Prints string starting from 3rd character
            print str * 2 # Prints string two times
            print str + "TEST" # Prints concatenate
            </code>
<p>We get the Output as:</p>
          <code>
            Hello World!
            H
            llo
            llo World!
            Hello World!Hello World!
            Hello World!TEST
          </code>
        </p>
        <li><u><b>Lists:</b></u></li>
        <p>
          Lists are the most versatile of Python's compound data types. A list contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]). To some extent, lists are similar to arrays in C. One difference between them is that all the items belonging to a list can be of different data type.

          The values stored in a list can be accessed using the slice operator ([ ] and [:]) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the list and working their way to end -1. The plus (+) sign is the list concatenation operator, and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator.

          <code>
            #!/usr/bin/py
            
            counter = 100 # An integer assignment
            miles = 1000.0 # A floating point
            name = "John" # A string
            print counter
            print miles
            print name
            </code>
          <p>We get the Output as:</p>
          <code>
            100
            1000.0
          </code>
          <li><u><b>Tuples:</b></u></li>
          <p id="listpara6">A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within parentheses.

            The main differences between lists and tuples are: Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists.

            <div class="box11"><code>
              #!/usr/bin/python
              
              tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 )
              tinytuple = (123, 'john')
              
              print tuple # Prints the complete tuple
              print tuple[0] # Prints first element of the tuple
              print tuple[1:3] # Prints elements of the tuple starting from 2nd till 3rd 
              print tinytuple * 2 # Prints the contents of the tuple twice
              print tuple + tinytuple # Prints concatenated tuples
              </code>
      <p>We get the Output as:</p>
            <code>
              ('abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.2)
              abcd
              (786, 2.23)
              (2.23, 'john', 70.2)
              (123, 'john', 123, 'john')
              ('abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.2, 123, 'john')
                  </code>

            <li><u><b>Dictionary:</b></u></li>
            <p>Python's dictionaries are kind of hash table type. They work like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object.

              Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces ({ }) and values can be assigned and accessed using square braces ([]).

              <code>
                #!/usr/bin/python
                
                dict = {}
                dict['one'] = "This is one"
                dict[2] = "This is two"
                
                tinydict = {'name': 'john','code':6734, 'dept': 'sales'}
                

                print dict['one'] # Prints value for 'one' key
                print dict[2] # Prints value for 2 key
                print tinydict # Prints complete dictionary
                print tinydict.keys() # Prints all the keys
                print tinydict.values() # Prints all the values
                </code>
 <p>We get the Output as:</p>
              <code>
                This is one
                This is two
                {'dept': 'sales', 'code': 6734, 'name': 'john'}
                ['dept', 'code', 'name']
                ['sales', 6734, 'john']

    <header>Decision Making And Loops</header>
       <p id="para9">Decision making is anticipation of conditions occurring while execution of the program and specifying actions taken according to the conditions.

          Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE or FALSE as outcome. You need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute if outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.Python programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as TRUE, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as FALSE value.

          Python programming language provides following types of decision making statements.
        </p>
        <ul id="list3">
          <li><b>If Statements</b> : An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.</li>
          <li><b>If-Else Statements</b> : An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the boolean expression is FALSE.</li>
          <li><b>Nested If Statements</b> : You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).</li>
        </ul>

        <p id="para10">In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.

          Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.

          A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. </p>

        <ul id="list4">
          <li><b>While Statements</b> : Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is TRUE. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.</li>
          <li><b>For Statements</b> : Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.</li>
          <li><b>Do-While Statements</b> : You can use one or more loop inside any another while, for or do..while loop.</li>
        </ul>

        <p id="para11">Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.

          Python supports the following control statements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>

        <ul id="list5">
          <li><b>Break Statements</b> : Terminates the loop statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.</li>
          <li><b>Continue Statements</b> : Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.</li>
          <li><b>Pass Statements</b> : The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.</li>

      <p>A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.

          As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. but you can also create your own functions. These functions are called user-defined functions.</p>

        <p>Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).

          Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.

          The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or docstring.

          The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.

          The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.
          Syntax :</p>

        <code>def functionname( parameters ):
          "function_docstring"
          function_suite
          return [expression]
      </code>
          <p>Defining a function only gives it a name, specifies the parameters that are to be included in the function and structures the blocks of code.

            Once the basic structure of a function is finalized, you can execute it by calling it from another function or directly from the Python prompt. Following is the example to call printme() function −

            <code>#!/usr/bin/python
              
              # Function definition is here
              def printme( str ):
              "This prints a passed string into this function"
              print str
              return;
              
              # Now you can call printme function
              printme("I'm first call to user defined function!")
              printme("Again second call to the same function")<br></code>

            <code>I'm first call to user defined function!
              Again second call to the same function</code>

    <article>
            <p>A module allows you to logically organize your Python code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference.

              Simply, a module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code.You can use any Python source file as a module by executing an import statement in some other Python source file.When the interpreter encounters an import statement, it imports the module if the module is present in the search path. A search path is a list of directories that the interpreter searches before importing a module. </p>

                <code>import module1[, module2[,... moduleN]</code>

                <code>#!/usr/bin/python
                  
                  # Import module support
                  import support
                  
                  # Now you can call defined function that module as follows
                  support.print_func("Zara")</code>

                <code>Hello : Zara</code>

    <header>File Input and Output</header>
    <article>
                     <p>The simplest way to produce output is using the print statement where you can pass zero or more expressions separated by commas. Python provides two built-in functions to read a line of text from standard input, which by default comes from the keyboard.The raw_input([prompt]) function reads one line from standard input and returns it as a string (removing the trailing newline).his prompts you to enter any string and it would display same string on the screen. When I typed "Hello Python!",The input([prompt]) function is equivalent to raw_input, except that it assumes the input is a valid Python expression and returns the evaluated result to you.Until now, you have been reading and writing to the standard input and output. Now, we will see how to use actual data files.

                  Python provides basic functions and methods necessary to manipulate files by default. You can do most of the file manipulation using a file object.Before you can read or write a file, you have to open it using Python's built-in open() function. This function creates a file object, which would be utilized to call other support methods associated with it.

  <section class="main-section" id="Exception_Handling">
    <header>Exception Handling</header>
    <article>
        <p>Python provides two very important features to handle any unexpected error in your Python programs and to add debugging capabilities in them −

                  Exception Handling − This would be covered in this tutorial. Here is a list standard Exceptions available in Python: Standard Exceptions.

                  Assertions − This would be covered in Assertions in Python tutorial.An assertion is a sanity-check that you can turn on or turn off when you are done with your testing of the program.

                  The easiest way to think of an assertion is to liken it to a raise-if statement (or to be more accurate, a raise-if-not statement). An expression is tested, and if the result comes up false, an exception is raised.

                  Assertions are carried out by the assert statement, the newest keyword to Python, introduced in version 1.5.

                  Programmers often place assertions at the start of a function to check for valid input, and after a function call to check for valid output.An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. An exception is a Python object that represents an error.

                  When a Python script raises an exception, it must either handle the exception immediately otherwise it terminates and quits.If you have some suspicious code that may raise an exception, you can defend your program by placing the suspicious code in a try: block. After the try: block, include an except: statement, followed by a block of code which handles the problem as elegantly as possible.Python also allows you to create your own exceptions by deriving classes from the standard built-in exceptions.

                  Here is an example related to RuntimeError. Here, a class is created that is subclassed from RuntimeError. This is useful when you need to display more specific information when an exception is caught.

                  In the try block, the user-defined exception is raised and caught in the except block. The variable e is used to create an instance of the class Networkerror.</p>
